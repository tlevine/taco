Turn data into tacos.

* Factor: asada/cabesa/carnitas/...
* Logical: Hot sauce
* Logical: Salsa

Number of tacos and arrangement on the plate could mean something too.




While data gastronomy is a promising approach for big data analysis,
it hasn't caught on. This is partly because of the difficulty of scaling
a data gastronomification analysis. Varying the ingredients for
individual dishes involves quite a bit of specialized work, and this
needs to be streamlined before data gastronomification will be practical
for industry use. Taco caravan is my attempt at solving this.

Taco caravan is a library for distributed data gastronomification in R.
It leverages the commodity food production establishments to build
robust, automated, scalabale, realtime data gastronomification workflows.
